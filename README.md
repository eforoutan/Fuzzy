# Fuzzy
This is a GitHub repository for MATLAB and Python codes used in the paper research titled "Data-Driven, Exprt-Drivern and Hybrid Tuned Fuzzy Models for Heat Vulnerability: A Comparative Study of Two Texas Metropolitan Areas" by Ehsan Foroutan

For implementing the FLAML autoML, final_FLAML.ipynb was used which runs over 5-fold train and test dataset as the results are the benchmark for machine learning algorithms.

For modeling accuracy assesment, three fuzzy logic model used the same 5-fold train and test dataset for both Austin and Dallas (DFW).

For the final models, the entire data set was used.

Fuzzy expert rules are included in fuzzy_rules_19.txt file which comprised of 19 rules.
