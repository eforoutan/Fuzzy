## FLAML AutoML Implementation
The notebook **`final_FLAML.ipynb`** implements the FLAML AutoML framework.  
It runs a 5-fold trainâ€“test evaluation, which provides benchmark results for the machine learning algorithms.

---

## Fuzzy Model Accuracy Assessment
Three fuzzy logic models were trained and tested using the same 5-fold dataset for both **Austin** and **Dallas (DFW)**.  
For the **final models**, the entire dataset was used.
